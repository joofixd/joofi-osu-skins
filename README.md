# my osu! skins (mixed skins other people's skins)
skins that i use frequently (of course i won't add every skin i have downloaded but i will add all the ones that i use often and/or like a lot)

ALSO, just some info on my bwpgy skins, since there's a number of them: bwpgy is a mixed skin i started to work on around june 2018. the goal of it was to be simple, minimalistic, and comfortable. it's called bwpgy because of the combo colors, which are blue, white, pink, green, and yellow. i chose those colors because i thought that they would be colorful but not distracting, which i was right in assuming so. ironically, every bwpgy skin other than the original "bwpgy" does not use those combo colors. bwpgy dt uses white. bwpgy 2.0 uses blue, white, pink, and green. bwpgy 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 use blue, white, purple, green, and red. weeb elements are also barely seen in these skins. there is only a Kreygasm anime girl moan combobreak, which can be removed, japanese characters in the score, a kaomoji emoticon face paired with an anime girl saying some shit i can't understand (welcome picture and audio file), and an anime menu-background that i may occasionally change and update.
