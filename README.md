# my osu! skins (mixed skins and other people's skins. not a single one is my original creation)
skins that i use frequently (of course i won't add every skin i have downloaded but i will add all the ones that i use often and/or like a lot)

# THE SKIN AT THE TOP IS MY MOST USED SKIN, OTHER SKINS I USE VERY OFTEN ARE LABELED APPROPRIATELY.

labels are "very often used", "kinda often used", "sometimes used", "rarely used", and "never used"

some skins may appear different than the picture when putting them in the game. that's because i update the download file often and change my skins every now and then. they are easily customizable in the folder of the skin. if you need any help with my skins, feel free to dm me on discord @joofi#9192 and i'll respond asap. i'll update this page (skin preview picture, dl files, etc.) as often as i can.

INFO ON BWPGY SKINS: these skins are mix skins that i began to work on in june 2018 (i still edit shit everyday). i did not create any of the files. the goal of these skins are to be comfortable, minimalistic, and playable. there are VERY minimal weeb elements (welcome files, combobreak, a couple more maybe i forgot) that can be easily removed. oh yea, and the name is bwpgy because the original idea was to have the combo colors be blue, white, pink, green, and yellow, but more recent skins in the lineup don't really follow that rule.
